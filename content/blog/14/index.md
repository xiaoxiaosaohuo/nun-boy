I've been thinking and struggling about how to be active in a conversation, I want to get the hang of conversation, unfortunately, it turns out to be true that everything doesn't have a shortcut, it needs to pay effort and time, tree can not grow up in a day. It'll feel frustrated and passive when you are not fully engaged in a conversation, don't have a good understanding clearly what they are talking about, especially, it's a business meeting, it needs you to make a decision, or answer some questions, without being familiar with the context and topic, you'll put yourself in a dilemma.
Recently,I've learned some interesting tricks about how to be active in a conversation, these skills are very simple and actionable.

## Compliment others

Don't be mean with your praise, in a daily conversation, when the speaker is saying something interesting, the best option is to give some positive feedback, as a result, the speaker would feel better, we can imagine when we give a speech, the audience give us negative response,'oh, your talking is so bad', what would you feel about that ?

Making some compliment is very rewarding for having a good relationship in conversation.

'That's so funny'
'It's awesome'
......

## Mindset shift

Want to be more active in a conversation, we should have a mindset shit, try to have an interest in what the speaker talk about, have a willing to dig more details from him, let the conversation goes deeper. Of course, there are someone we don't like, when you say 'I interviewed Google today', somebody replies with 'I want to interview Google too', so boring and disappointed it is, he does't show any interest to others, how do you think that makes the speaker feel?

Shifting the mindset can lead you to a successful conversation,be interested in other's story and life.

'How was that?'
'What made you want to do that?
'Can you tell me more about that, it's so interesting'

## Listening actively

Guess or mirror the other persons words and emotions, taking their words, then restating it, in this way, it makes them feel heard, you're actively listening to the words that they're using and you're able to use it yourself to reflect their feelings, this is a great type of listening.

## Body language

To remember the body language, we can use Nose as a acronym, it means:

- nodding
- open posture
- smile
- eye contact

Nose can help people know that you're ready and willing to talk, even if you haven't said much yet.
