In this new year --- 2023, there are many things happen to me, fortunate or unfortunate, they would have a deep impact on my rest life.

1. Welcome my son, he came into our life in Jan 23th, what a lovely and fascinating boy, even though, he brought pain for us in the early few days, he turned the situation around. We hope he can live a happy and free life, enjoy every minute.
2. This is a big shock for me, I was laied off by company from Jannuary 15th, thanks to the worse and worse economic environment, I did not find a ideal job. I keep looking for job opportunities. 
Best wishes for myself, good luck!
