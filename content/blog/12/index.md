I'm from China, English is my second language.
I started to learn English from alphabet 'A,B,C' until entering into junior high school, it seemed that I had a talent in learning English, I could get a perfect score in every exam, which make me excited and inspired. So,it has been more than 10 years in my English journey, however, what I learned is a kind of school English or textbook English, we are all good at solve the exam problems, can get a ideal result,we never have a chance to talk with foreigners, native speakers,which lead to we can not have a connection with them, we can read, write, but can not speaking.

I'm strongly want to improve my English skills, trying a bunch of workarounds, such as reciting the vocabularies, phrases,practicing pronunciation, but could not make it as a habit and lack of continuousness, as a result, my English didn't have a evident improvement.

Until 2021, my spoken English is very bad, it made me feel frustrating when speaking with a native speaker or having a meeting in English. Why was it that?

Being couldn't understand the conversation clearly made me don't know what to say, afraid of loosing face, being laughed at, also, don't know how to structure the idea, the shortage of vocabularies bogged me down on how to express my idea, my thought, which words should I use, how to translate it? Yeah, it was a serious problem, I couldn't think in English, when I wanted to speak in English, first I thought in Chinese, then translated it in English, finally, spoke it, this was the most inefficient way.

Since 2021,I keep watching videos in Youtube, what I watched the most is English teaching videos, I subscribed a lot of popular channels, met many excellent English teachers who shared hundreds thousands videos about how to learn English, I've learned a lot from them, they brought me into this brand new world, giving me actionable and useful methods to sharpen English skills. One of the most impressive and pragmatic ways is Repetition.

Practice makes perfect. The only way to get better is practice English over and over, it is Repetition.

So what I am doing now is coaching myself, to be my own teacher. What's the benefit becoming a coach?

- coach myself, get my ear in better shape for repeating
- record myself to help start to thinking in English,bridge the gap between all the work what I am doing and being able to use those new habits in a conversation.

It cost me 30min to write this piece of blog, I felt so concentrated, next time I should use what I learned to write a blog, the vocabularies, the phrases, the expressions.

I like this feeling, it can give me a positive feedback immediately, which can build up my confidence.
