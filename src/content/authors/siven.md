I'm a multi-talented professional with expertise in full-stack development, photography, and writing. I create beautiful and functional websites and applications that provide an exceptional user experience. 

I'm also a passionate photographer who captures stunning landscapes and unique perspectives on everyday objects. As a bilingual writer, I record my thoughts and ideas in both English and Chinese, exploring different topics and expressing myself through words.
