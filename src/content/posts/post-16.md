These times, I ofen reflect on my past experience, examinming my life and contemplating my current sistuation.
Through this introspection, I have come to the realization that happiness is not easily achieved in life.

My son has a strong prefrence for being breasted by his mother and doesn't enjoy consuming milk through other means. 
We want to provide him with complete nutritional support to facilitate his growth and development, so we have decided to supplement breastfeeding with formula, however, as we already know he refuesed the formula.

After a few days, I realized that I need to change the way we were supplementing breastfeeding with formula. Whenever he feels hungry and seeks food, we give him a small amount of formula before breastfeeding him. This approach helps him become accustomed to the taste of formula gradually, rather than giving him a large amount of formula at once, it just like the algorithm of divide and counquer, and it's also from the 《Atomic Habits》, makes the good habit simple and easy.

When he started accepting this method and began to eat, I felt so happy, as if all the troubles of the day had disappeared.
