Emotions are controlling us all day, there are several basic emotions, such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust..., these basic emotions are considered uniserval, experienced by people worldwide regardless of culture,they significatly influence our daily lives, affecting decisions, behaviors, and interactions with others. Maybe we want to control these emotions to let them help us, however, emotions are controlled by our primitive brain, it's not easy to control them, even though it's still has some approaches to target the goal.

By controlling our emotions, we can improve our motivation, our attention and our memory.

I have several simple ways to make the emotions under our control.

1. Stop trying so hard, when we doing something ,just to approach it as a child, consider it as a play, if you use your musels so hard, it's not enjoyable, you're in pain the next day. But if you could play with it in a very easy,simple, enjoyable way, you'll keep the motivation and go further.
2. Finding a place or material that makes you fell good, or gives you good vibes, this can be very personal,
we connect information to our emotion,we remember it more easily, the brain becomes more of a sponge to absorb anything. When I am reading, I search a video that plays sounds for relaxing, focus, it can make me calm down and deep into the flow.
3.Psychological safety. We don't live in a world where we need to be fearful if we say the wrong thing. so we should speak up with ideas, questions,  concerns, or admitting mistakes, this can free your heart and brain, makes you more positive, active in a loop feedback,.

These are my finding these days, I just write them down for retrospectition.
