Start from the beginning, if the beginning is difficult, stick with it until it becomes a little more easier. Progress will come slowly, it takes dedication and daily practice. 

## 1. Name objects around you in English
Simply look around you and, in your head, name what you see.
If there's somehting you can't describe, look up the words you need in a dictionary and memorize them. Memorize that phrase. Learning in context like this will help you hold onto that word for future use. I suggest getting an English-only dictionary rather than a translating dictionary between English and your native language. 
## 2. Think in simple sentences
Think of a beginning of a sentence, What simple sentences can you say that describe the room around you.
## 3. Have small conversations with yourself in English
Just thinking, not speaking out loud, have simple conversations with yourself on a daily basis. Talk about the day, your work, your children, anything. Dedicate 30 days to this exercise and you'll definitely see improvement in your ability to think in English.

## 4. Change one of your everyday life tasks to English
Switch your canlendar to English, write your grocery list in English, your to-do list, conduct internet serarches in English, doing these things will demand that your brain get comfortable thinking in English.

## 5. Narrate your actions in your head as you do them

Narrate your actions in your head as you do them. Here is an examle of narrating what I'm doing right now: "I'm typing on my keyboard, I'm writing a blog post"

## 6. Learn how to do something in English
Choose something that you really think you'll enjoy. it could be knitting, learning a new game,watching videos on YouTube, the options are endless, make sure you speak in English.
## 7. Keep track of the exercises you're doing everyday

At the end of the day, write down the ways you practiced thinking in English.ou might write: “I described my office in English and had a short conversation with myself about the weather on the ride home.” This may seem simple, but it will do a great job reinforcing the practice you’re putting in and help you feel the results.

## 8. Recap your day in English when you go to bed

Think through your day from beginning to end in English. Try and be as detailed as you can. If there is something you did that you don’t know the English word for, remember to look it up in the morning! It might be a good idea to have a notebook next to the bed to write down anything you want to look up the following day based on this practice.
