Writing is a great skill, when you are writing something, your mind will turn to a more concentrated mode, where you indulge yourself into a world, full of the things you loved,you feel relaxed, light, happy, as a result you can organize ideas more efficient, in general, awesome ideas have a great chance to come out. However, someone can write amazing blog, while some others always struggle with writing, as we all know, writing is a skill, so, as long as finding out some secrets, then practice it continuously and deliberately, there will be a happy ending.

I've read some articles about how to become a better writer, I just write it down to make myself more familiar with them.

## Avoid "I think", "I believe", "It seems"

Choosing proper word is essential to express thoughts and ideas, having a good word choice tells how to pick up the best words and how to remove the bad words.

If you are writing, then it's obvious you're what you think and believe, so there is no need to preface every expression with "I think", omitting those words makes your points stronger.

1. I think you'll like these tips
2. you will like these tips

the second sentence is better than the first one 100 times.

## Writing the title first

I'm always thinking what to write this week, I have a plenty of ideas, but don't know where to start when opening the editor.

The better approach to writing a well-structured blog is to having a title first, when you have a title, you have a clear idea what you want to write and what you won't talk this time, because it's have noting to do with current topic. Focusing on one little thing one time, put your effort in it, then you'll make it a success.

## Musical

We all know when speaking sounds like singing a song, it becomes more attractive and interesting, writing is the same thing, need music.

What does the music mean in writing? Play it just like a song, create a rhythm, write with a combination of short, medium and long sentences, in this way, creating a sound that pleases the reader's ear.

Don't just write words, write music

## Simplicity and Clarity

Keep in mind, simplicity and clarity are the highest principle in the world.
Expressing simply and making your idea clear is not an easy work, it need you're versed in what you want to talk, then using simple words or sentences to express it.

Long-winded is tedious.
Boring is archenemy.
