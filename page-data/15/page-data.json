In some cases, I must bragg about something in a strategic way.</li>\n<li>Take the lead, lead yourself, change my mind about the meeting, even if I know it doesn’t have much matter with me, must be curious about what they are talking about, and think about it, then you can engaged into the meeting, don’t make myself be an outsider.I can share what I know anything about the topic, I can help others to improve their ideas. Finally, listening carefully will learn something new, have more contact with others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know these very great suggestions, but when the problem happens, I couldn’t take any action to rescue myself. I don’t have the related thoughts about the topic, so can not figure out where is the problem what I can do, I just in the meeting without any word from the beginning to the end.</p>\n<p>What I need to do firstly is to compel myself to be prepared and ready to ask questions, use critical thinking in the meeting, don’t be lazy and sloppy in mind.</p>\n<p>Keep concentrate on the topic, then I can toot my own horn in one day.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Toot your own horn","date":"September 07, 2022","description":"take the initiative to promote yourself and work "}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/14/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"To be active in a conversation"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"f31b188c-92ca-5594-a39b-affb3b4b5f07","previousPostId":"12f7e88e-6b37-5500-bde7-021b4badb415","nextPostId":null}},
